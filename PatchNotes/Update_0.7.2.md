Bugfix for suit config window size for new users.




## Bugfixes

- Fixed that new users would have a way too small suit config window
- Fixed a few tooltips in the suit config window
- Changed the 'resize' button of the suit config window to always be visible
  - It is not clear that the window can be resized otherwise, and other mods often do not offer similar functionality, so we decided to have it shown to convey this ability.
