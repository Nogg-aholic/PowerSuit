New helper visuals for a Suit with no installed Modules.




This update brought to you by Robb#6731. I got the chance to conduct some usability testing involving this mod, and a few of these changes are a result of that.

## New Stuff

- New visuals to draw attention to the module slots of an empty, freshly-equipped Suit. Goes away once any module is installed.
  - It's easy for new users to miss the slots for installing modules in a suit. This change should help with that.
