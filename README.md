# PowerSuit

_This mod is now maintained by Robb#6731, please contact him instead of Nog with questions_

Please report bugs on [on the Nog's Mods Discord](https://discord.gg/JjngemP9A4) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/Nogg-aholic/PowerSuit/issues) (slower response).

**This mod should fully work in Multiplayer.**

This mod is a **library mod** that adds "suit" back slot equipment items with inventories, and "equipment module descriptors." Modules placed in the inner inventory of the Suit can influence the bonuses it provides, or execute their own custom code. Before more body slots were base game, this mod was the go-to choice. Now, this mod allows for advanced custom equipment items.

### !! This mod itself does not add any Modules, nor any Suits! You will have to install other mods for that. !!

To find Modules and Suits, check out the PowerSuit Modules mods:

## Controls

Keybinds can be adjusted in the base-game Keybind Menu.

Note that some controls will not do anything unless you have a module that grants you that ability.

The default controls are:

* Hold Space to activate Fly Mode
* Hold "Space" to ascend
* Hold "Shift" to accelerate directionally (obeys base game Toggle Sprint settings)
* Hold "C" to descend or apply brakes
* Press "G" to toggle gravity flight mode
* Press "K" to toggle frictionless flight mode
* Press "Ctrl+Shift+M" to show your mouse cursor anywhere
  * You can use this to free your cursor if another mod messes it up
  * Allows you to view tooltips on HUD elements
* Press "Ctrl+L" to switch to 3rd Person Camera
  * Does _not_ need SML cheats enabled
  * Hand equipment animations are slightly buggy
* Press "Right-Alt" to open the PowerSuit Config Window
  * Config Window can be resized by dragging the bottom right corner
  * Config Window can be dragged and moved on screen by grabbing the Title

## Showcase

For a more detailed description of suits' functions and modes, see the [PowerSuit Modules mod page](https://ficsit.app/mod/ArmorModules).

When equipped, the Suit's inner Inventory can be found in the player's inventory below their hand slots. ( This is using NogsPowersuit )

Fuse and Overdraw

If your suit runs out of power, you will enter Overdraw. The HUD's Fuse Indicator light will turn orange, your handheld controllers will gain a red warning background, and their Overdraw progress bar will begin to increase. While Overdrawing, you can consume an unlimited amount of power, but if you are still out of power when the Overdraw progress bar reaches the maximum, your suit will have to Reboot.

Rebooting

When your suit begins to reboot, all of your installed Modules will cease to function, and you must wait for the suit to reboot again before you can use them. This is certainly not advantageous while flying, or in a dangerous environment, so consider investing in modules that increase your Power Capacity or Power Generation.
