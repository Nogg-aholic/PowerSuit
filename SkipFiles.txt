# This file defines items in the private repo that will not be copied into the public one
# by the script that copies files out of a multi-mod project-level repo into public repos.
# This should not be used as a replacement for the repo's gitignore,
# but instead to save time and disk space by avoiding copying build files that are already gitignored.
# Glob syntax, # is comment, but the globs are evaluated based on the script running directory so it's best to prefix everything with **/ to ensure it will work
